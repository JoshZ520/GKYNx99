# 📱 Offline Fallback System

This directory contains the **offline fallback** version of Table Talk for situations where multiplayer isn't available.

## 🎯 When to Use This

- **Server is down** - No internet connection to multiplayer server
- **Testing locally** - Want to test game logic without networking
- **Backup mode** - Multiplayer fails and you need a quick alternative
- **Single device** - Only one device available for all players

## 📁 Fallback Structure

```
📁 fallback/
├── 📄 front.html              → Player setup (enter names)
├── 📄 display.html            → Results display page
├── 📁 scripts/
│   ├── 📄 answers.js          → Answer processing utilities
│   ├── 📄 question.js         → Question display logic
│   └── 📄 display.js          → Results page logic
└── 📁 stylesheets/
    ├── 📄 front_style.css     → Player setup styling
    └── 📄 display.css         → Results page styling
```

## 🚀 How to Use Fallback Mode

### Option 1: Direct Access
```
1. Open fallback/front.html in browser
2. Set up players manually
3. Play on single device (pass around)
4. View results on fallback/display.html
```

### Option 2: Automatic Fallback (Recommended)
Add this to your main index.html to auto-detect server issues:
```javascript
// Auto-fallback if multiplayer fails
setTimeout(() => {
    if (!multiplayerConnected) {
        window.location.href = 'fallback/front.html';
    }
}, 5000); // 5 second timeout
```

## 🔄 Integration with Main Game

The fallback uses the same:
- ✅ **Question data** from `/files/topics/`
- ✅ **Image assets** from `/images/`
- ✅ **Session utilities** (shared from main)
- ✅ **Theme utilities** (shared from main)

## ⚠️ Limitations of Fallback Mode

- **No real-time sync** - Players take turns on one device
- **Manual progression** - Host controls everything manually
- **No phone interface** - Everyone uses the main screen
- **Basic UI** - Simpler interface than multiplayer version

## 🛠️ Maintenance

When updating the main game:
1. **Questions/Topics** - Automatically work in fallback
2. **Core game logic** - May need to update fallback scripts
3. **Styling** - Keep fallback CSS in sync if needed

💡 **Tip**: This fallback ensures your game **always works** even if technology fails!
